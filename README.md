<h3 data-end="672" data-start="646">What is BodyCode Keto?</h3>
<p data-end="1043" data-start="674"><a href="https://ketobodycode.com/"><strong data-end="691" data-start="674">BodyCode Keto</strong></a> is a dietary supplement formulated to enhance the process of ketosis &mdash; a natural metabolic state where your body burns fat instead of carbohydrates for energy. It contains powerful ingredients like BHB (Beta-Hydroxybutyrate) ketones, which act as exogenous ketones to help trigger and maintain ketosis even if your dietary intake is less than perfect.</p>
<p data-end="1239" data-start="1045">This supplement is designed to mimic the effects of a ketogenic diet without the extreme restrictions, allowing users to experience rapid fat burning, improved energy levels, and mental clarity.</p>

<h3 data-end="1273" data-start="1241">How Does BodyCode Keto Work?</h3>
<p data-end="1521" data-start="1275">Under normal dietary conditions, your body uses glucose (sugar from carbohydrates) as its primary energy source. However, when carb intake is reduced, the body enters a state of ketosis and begins to break down stored fat into ketones for energy.</p>
<p data-end="1611" data-start="1523"><strong data-end="1540" data-start="1523">BodyCode Keto</strong> accelerates this transition by providing exogenous BHB ketones, which:</p>
<ul data-end="1817" data-start="1613">
<li data-end="1655" data-start="1613">
<p data-end="1655" data-start="1615">Signal your body to enter ketosis faster</p>
</li>
<li data-end="1721" data-start="1656">
<p data-end="1721" data-start="1658">Provide an alternative energy source for your brain and muscles</p>
</li>
<li data-end="1817" data-start="1722">
<p data-end="1817" data-start="1724">Reduce the &ldquo;keto flu&rdquo; symptoms often experienced during the initial phase of a ketogenic diet</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p data-end="1925" data-start="1819">This means you can start burning fat for energy sooner and feel more energized and focused from the start.</p>
